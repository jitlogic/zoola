Zoola: Extensible Beanshell Runtime
===================================

Zoola is a beanshell variant with the following characteristics:
* (planned) interpreter/evaluation functions factored out of AST;;
* (planned) visitor-pattern binding AST and interpreter makes altering language semantics possible;
* (planned) strong sandboxing capabilities - utilizing persistent data structures to implement namespaces;
* (planned) some python-esque/project-lambda-like language extensions (iterator expressions, lambda functions etc.)

Note that this is still in development snapshot.

Zoola is derived from original beanshell and is backwards-compatible with beanshell itself.
